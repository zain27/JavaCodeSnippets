1. Do not blindly copy the code. If you do so mostly it will not work, and you will spend a lot of time debugging it. 
2. Understand the code and make changes to it. 
3. Feel free to share it with others. 
4. Each file will have a short description of what it does at the top. 
5. Reach out to me at zain.zahid27@gmail.com if you have any questions.
